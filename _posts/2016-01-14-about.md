I have been a member of the Delphi community for over 20 years. In 2012 I was nominated to become a "Embarcadero Community Evangelist", in fact I was the first member of Embarcadero's MVP program. Officially I am an MVP - "Most valued professional", like many others that became part of that community supporting program, but my original title has never been revoked, so you still might see tag lines of mine using that name :-)
